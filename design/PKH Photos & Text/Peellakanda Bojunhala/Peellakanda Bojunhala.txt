Over time, we saw others trying to cut corners, and we vowed to work harder to make 
food that you can trust. As GMOâ€™s, MSG, fillers, sweeteners and 
irradiation became increasingly common elsewhere, we deepened our commitment to our customers 
and to the planet. By 2007, we achieved our 100% Organic Certification, and in the following 
months we increased our line to include Certified Fair Trade, Kosher, Vegan, and Gluten 
Free products. In 2012, we developed a line of EcoShakers, a spice container that is 100% recyclable.
